# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
An convolutional neural network that detects metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. These scans are stained lymph nodes taken from biopsies, and are a common location for early stage breast cancer malignant cells to begin proliferation.

Trained and tesed on images from the PatchCamelyon dataset. 

ResNet50 is based on a deep residual framework. This has its origin in the squeeze excitation approach to cnn's described in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf
